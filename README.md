About  Library Management System Django Project
Moving on, this library management system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with issuing books and records. Also, the system displays all the available students with their issued books. In addition, the system allows managing books by entering a title, author, ISBN, and category. This project is divided into two categories: Student, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a student can simply register and start using it. Here, the system displays all the issued books for the student. The system limits other access to the student account. As he/she can only view issued book records which displays expiry dates, total fine charge, and others.
